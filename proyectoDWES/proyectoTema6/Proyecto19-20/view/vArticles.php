        <div class="title">Mount Everest: Highest Altitude</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Almost everyone calls Mount Everest "the highest mountain in the world," and climbers from everywhere travel to Everest hoping to earn the distinction of climbing the "World's Highest."</p>
            <p>Mount Everest is called the world's highest mountain because it has the "highest elevation above sea level." We could also say that it has the "highest altitude."</p>
            <p>The peak of Mount Everest is 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above sea level. No other mountain on Earth has a higher altitude. However, some mountains might be considered "taller" (with taller being "the total vertical distance between their base and their summit").</p>

        <div class="title">Mauna Kea: Tallest Mountain</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Mauna Kea has an altitude of 4,205 meters (13,796 feet) - much lower than Mount Everest. However, Mauna Kea is an island, and if the distance from the bottom of the nearby Pacific Ocean floor to the peak of the island is measured, then Mauna Kea is "taller" than Mount Everest.</p>
            <p>Mauna Kea is over 10,000 meters tall compared to 8,850 meters for Mount Everest - making it the "world's tallest mountain."</p>

        <div class="title">Chimborazo: Highest Above Earth's Center</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Chimborazo in Ecuador has an altitude of 6,310 meters (20,703 feet). Mount Everest has a higher altitude, and Mauna Kea is "taller." However, Chimborazo has the distinction of being the "highest mountain above Earth's center."</p>
            <p>This is because Earth is not a sphere - it is an oblate spheroid. As an oblate spheroid, Earth is widest at its equator. Chimborazo is just one degree south of the equator. At that location, it is 6,384 kilometers (3,967 miles) above Earth's center, or about 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) farther from Earth's center than Mount Everest.</p>
